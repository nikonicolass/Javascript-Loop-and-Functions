# Javascript Loop and Functions

This program is meant to be a jumping off point for anyone who are unfamiliar with solidity and wish to acquire a sense of how it functions.

## Description

A block, a condition, and a looping keyword are the three primary looping structures in JavaScript. There are other variations as well. The block, which is the body of the loop in these cases, is executed for the duration that the condition is true. The loop body is run only once, which is referred to as one iteration.
